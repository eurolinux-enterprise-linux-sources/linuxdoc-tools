*** This file describes the installation of the linuxdoc-tools package ***

You need to do the following things to get linuxdoc-tools installed:


o Get, make and install jade or openjade. This software needs
  nsgmls or onsgmls command from jade or openjade.

        The source of jade can be downloaded from
        <URL:ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/jade/>.
        This source archive contains source for both jade and sp.

        The website for openjade is <URL:http://openjade.sourceforge.net/>.

  Currently, openjade seems to be the way to go, but if your system
  has working jade already, you can use it safely.


o Configure linuxdoc-tools for your system:

     ./configure

  You can specify different installation prefixes during installation,
  the default prefix is `/usr/local'.
  For example: install linuxdoc-sgml to `/usr':

     ./configure --prefix=/usr

  If you have sgmls-1.1 already installed, you can leave
  out their compilation:

     ./configure --with-installed-sgmlsasp

  If you have entity-map already installed, you can use it:

     ./configure --with-installed-entity-map

  If you have iso-entities already installed, you can use it:

     ./configure --with-installed-iso-entities


o Compile SGML-Tools:

    make

  or
  
    gmake

  whatever calls GNU make on your system. If you don't have GNU make installed,
  get the sources from prep.ai.mit.edu now and install it - SGML-Tools needs
  it to compile.


o Install SGML-Tools:

    make install

  (You must probably be root to install in /usr/local and other system
  directories).

  Note:
    In order to use TeX/PS/PDF output, TeX style files in ./lib 
    subdirectory (linuxdoc-sgml.sty, linuxdoctr-sgml.sty, null.sty, 
    and qwertz.sty) are to be installed your LaTeX input directory,
    such as "/usr/share/tex/latex/misc/".
    Also url.sty and epsf.tex are required.  Newer version of them
    are available from recent teTeX distribution.  If you wish to
    have old ones, check the "./obsoleted" subdirectory.

  It might be a good idea to install in a temporary directory for testing,
  first (/tmp perhaps).

o the contrib directory has some interesting patches and scripts that may be
  useful to you.

o there is a guide on the linuxdoc-tools documentation  directory, it 
  describes how to use this package, read it next...
