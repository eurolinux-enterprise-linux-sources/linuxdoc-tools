    to enable the handling of a filename with spaces for text and rtf
    output. it seems that the latex command can not handle such file,
    but it is not fault on sgml-tools side, maybe.
    html browsers such as lynx and w3m can not handle such filenames
    in URIs, but I don't know it is their fault, because I am not
    sure the URI with spaces is allowed in RFC.
    Anyway, the reporter claims that he wish to use the filenames with
    spaces on rtf output, so I think this bug can be closed.
      - Closes: #27488
