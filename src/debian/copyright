This is `linuxdoc-tools', a series of tools to implement the Linux
Documentation Project HOWTO and book styles in SGML.

linuxdoc-tools package is currently maintained by Agustin Martin Domingo
<agmartin@debian.org> within the Debian XML/SGML Group

It was previously maintained by Taketoshi Sano <sano@debian.org>.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

linuxdoc-tools is derived from linuxdoc-SGML, originally written by
Matt Welsh and later maintained by Cees de Groot. Linuxdoc-SGML is
based on James Clark's sgmls parser, and the QWERTZ DTD by Tom
Gordon. Magnus Alvestad provided the current HTML support. For
the rest of linuxdoc-SGML,

Original Linuxdoc-SGML itself does not have any limitations.
Everything not having explicit additional conditions can be freely
used, modified, and redistributed, under the usual fair use clauses:

 * No warranty. Use at your own risk.
 * Do not pretend to have written what you did not.

Since then, lots of smaller and bigger changes resulted in a rename
to SGML-Tools (and then to SGMLtools, the hyphen caused confusion)
to indicate that it wasn't just for Linux anymore. See files
CHANGES.old-v1 and CONTRIBUTORS.old-v1 for changelog and list of
contributors to old linuxdoc-sgml and sgmltools-v1.

When sgml-tools dropped support for the linuxdoc DTD, Taketoshi Sano
<sano@debian.org> forked the code to linuxdoc-tools. See README file.
