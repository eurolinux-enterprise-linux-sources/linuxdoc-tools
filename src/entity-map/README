INTRODUCTION

    EntityMap is a set of look-up tables for translating SGML
    character entity names into output formats.  This release of
    EntityMap includes mappings for the ISO 8879:1986 character entity
    sets to ASCII, Latin 1, TeX, Texinfo, and RTF.

    EntityMap includes a Perl module for reading and querying the
    entity mapping tables.  Documentation is in PerlDoc in `EntityMap'
    and will also be installed as a man page as `Text::EntityMap(3)'.

STATUS

    The mapping tables in this release come directly from GF (General
    Formatter) by Gary Houston.

    Upcoming releases will merge mappings from SGML Tools and Jade.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    These are Gary Houston's acknowledgements for the initial `sdata'
    files:

     *  The tables for the conversion of `ISOlat1' to ``best'' ASCII
        follow a system developed by Markus Kuhn.

     *  `ISOlat1.2tex' is based on a `latin1' to TeX table by (I
        think) Peter Flynn.

     *  Other TeX symbols were grabbed individually from numerous
        sources.

INSTALLATION

    If you are not using the Perl module you can copy the files in the
    `sdata' directory to wherever you need them.

    If you are using the Perl module, the following commands will
    install the Perl module into your standard Perl library and
    install the `sdata' files into `$PREFIX/lib/entity-map-0.1'.

    zcat entity-map-0.1.tar.gz | tar xvf -
    cd entity-map-0.1
    ./configure
    make
    make install

FORMAT

    Each file contains one character entity per line.  Each line is
    the entity name, followed by a tab, followed by the replacement
    text for that entity.

    The replacement text should be already escaped properly for it's
    output format.

    If there is no equivalent output format for an entity, the
    convention is use the entity name within braces (`{name}') so that
    the braces appear in the output.

    NOTE:  The file format may change in the future.  Other output
    formats may also require a new file format.

FILE NAMES

    The current convention is `ENTITY-SET.2FORMAT' where ENTITY-SET
    is the source entity set name (like `ISOpub') and FORMAT is an
    identifier for the output format:

        .2ab    ASCII (best approximation)
        .2as    ASCII
        .2l1b   Latin 1 (best approximation)
        .2l1s   Latin 1
        .2tex   TeX
        .2texi  Texinfo
        .2rtf   RTF
        .2tr    TROFF
