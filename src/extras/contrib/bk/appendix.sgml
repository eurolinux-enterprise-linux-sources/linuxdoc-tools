<sect>Main Body Text Section
<p>
The main body of the text is structured as usual,
consisting of (possibly) chapters, sections,
subsections, subsubsections, paragraphs, and
subpragraphs. You will be able to use the same
kind of classification to organize your appendices.


<appendix>

<sect>Top Level Appendix
<p>
As you can see, appendices are just structured like
the main body of the text, but bracketed by the
<c><appendix></c> element.
