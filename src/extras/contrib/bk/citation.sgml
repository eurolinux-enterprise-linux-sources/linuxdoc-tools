<title>TEST: Quotes, Citation, and Bibliography
<author>b. kreimeier
<date>May 1997

<sect>Quotes
<p>
Quotations are paragraphs, distinctly rendered. The following
is taken from the <q>TEI Gentle Introduction to SGML</q>,
as published by the Text Encoding Initiative. Note that
you are already encountered the inlined quotation within
this paragraph. Now here's a full quote.
<quote>
Historically, the word markup has been used to describe
annotation or other marks within a text intended to
instruct a compositor or typist how a particular passage
should be printed or laid out: e.g. wavy underlining to
indicate boldface.
</quote>
Quotations that are not inlined are paragraphs, and you
might use an optional caption with them.
<quote>
As formatting and printing of textes
was automated, the term was extended to cover all sorts
of special markup codes inserted into electronic texts
to govern formatting, printing, or other processing.
<!-- caption>

</caption -->
</quote>

Make sure to mark all inlined quotations appropriately,
so both indented quotations paragraphs, marked by
the <c><quote></c>, and small single line quotes marked
with <c><c></c> can be indentified as belonging to the same
category.


<sect>Citations
<p>
SGML Tools currently support a simple citation mechanism,
which works with LaTeX and HTML, but not yet with ASCII
backends. See
<citeref key="sgmltool.dtd">SGMLTOOL DTD proposal</citeref> 
for details on the actual implementation.
As you can see, a hyperlink-resembling
<c><citeref></c> element is available. In consequence, annotation as
with the QWERTZ DTD <cite key="qwertz.dtd"> and the original
Linuxdoc DTD <cite key="linuxdoc96.dtd"> is not supported.
There is, obviously, support for simple bracketed references,
though, with the <c><cite></c> element.
<p>
Hidden citations by <c><citeonly></c> (no citations within the text,
but the actual reference will be present in the bibliography)
and an alternative <c><citeall></c> element to enforce inclusion of all
entries in the database are supported, but might be used
only within the bibliography element. The <c><citeall></c>
element might be rendered obselete in the future by 
improved handling of parameter based conditionals in the
backend.

<sect>Bibliography
<p>
The bibliography itself is invoked by the <c><bibliogr></c> element
at the end of the file. It might contain one <c><citeall></c>
element, or several <c><citeonly></c> elements, followed by a
<c>bibdb</c> element that contains one reference to
source files. Note that, like with images, only the name,
not the file format qualifying extension is to be given.
<p>
Current restrictions: in the <c>bib2html</c> based HTML backend,
there is no filtering for entries not cited. This would
have to be based on <c>citefind.sh</c> and <c>citetags.sh</c>
found in the <c>bibextract</c> package. There is currently no
support for multiple BibTeX files (as implied by the design of
the <c><bibdb></c> element), and the style parameter is currently
not supported: both require parsing of the SGML source prior
to invoking <c>bib2html</c> within the HTML backend.
<p>
There are no checks done by the validating parser to
verify references. Only the BibTeX processing
in the LaTeX backend provides any checks whatsoever.
So there.

<bibliogr>
<citeall>
<bibdb>
<bibdata src="sgmltool"> <!-- bibdata src="bibtex" -->
</bibdb>
