<title>TEST: Notes and Remarks
<author>b. kreimeier
<date>May 1997


<sect>Regular Text Section
<p>
This is supposed to be a regular paragraph concerning
notes, that is remarks that might be rendered as insertions,
footnotes or endnotes. From a theoretical point of view,
a <c><note></c> is anything that requires a stack-like
operations on the part of the reader - push the current
context, context switch to process the insertion, restore
the previous context - cognitively speaking.
<p>
As far as the rendering is concerend, things are even more
sutble. The concept of footnotes is a tricky one,
as it does not translate to Hypertext
<note>
Hypertext has no real concept of a page footer or
bottom. Basically, a footnote is something to put
in a separate module or (for HTML) on another page.
</note>
or Folding Editors
<note>
Folding is a Hypertext-like concept, but the rendering
of a previously hidden fold is done by unfolding it
into the current text. Folds are hidden behind
headings, like hypertext hides behind references
(or, with HTML, resource locators), but they are
conceptually different, because, once unfolded,
they integrate seamlessly into the surrounding
text. Emacs' outline mode is a prime example.
</note>
easily - the very word itself is tied to the
visual appearance of a printed page of text.
<p>
For LaTeX backends, <c><note></c> elements will
be handled classically, as footnotes or, using
the <c>endnotes</c> package, as endnotes. ASII
backends will simply include the text, marked as
NOTE and bracketed, as a simple insertion within
the flow of text. Currently, the same solution is
used with the HTML backend, but it would be more
desirable to collect all notes of an entire section,
or the whole document, on a separate page. Just as
well, one page for each single note is doable as well.
Hypertext, after all, is about fragmentation of 
information beyond retrieval...
