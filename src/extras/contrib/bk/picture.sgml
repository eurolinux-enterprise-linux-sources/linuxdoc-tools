<title>TEST: Image and Figure
<author>b. kreimeier
<date>May 1997

<abstract>
This is a test file regarding the use of pictures,
as inlined images within text, and as figures
consisting of one or more pictures, with an
required caption, and treated as a separate
paragraph. 
</abstract>


<sect>Images
<p>
Inlined Images like 
<img id="small_picture">
will appear at or below the position at
which they are included in the text. You will note that ASCII backends
provide only a bracketed string (a required alternative
descrption of the image). The following picture
has its own paragraph.
<p>
<img id="small_picture">
<p>
 In case of
subsequent multiple images like 
<img id="small_picture">
<img id="small_picture">,
the order will be kept.
<p>
Images could contain ASCII art from <c>id.txt</c> files
that will be merged into the ouput (not yet available).
Currently, only the file name is emitted.

<sect>Figures
<p>
Figures will always be centered, and separated from the
text. They might float on the page they are introduced
on, but should not appear prior to their actual
introduction with the LaTex backend, which tries to
match preserve the locations created by the HTML backend.
<p>
A typical single image figure, with required caption:
<figure>
<img id=picture >
<caption>Single Image Figure</caption>
</figure>
<p>
Figures can be composed of multiple images, but will
always have only
one caption. <figure>
<img id=picture >
<img id=picture >
<img id=picture >
<caption>Multi Image Figure</caption>
</figure>
It is thus possible to arrange images in a row, but 
subsequent figures will appear in a column. Note that
the backend has to take care of width and height
limitations - currently, not even LaTeX does.

<figure>
<img id=picture>
<caption>Top Figure</caption>
</figure>
<figure>
<img id=picture>
<caption>Bottom Figure</caption>
</figure>
<p>
You will get the error message
"document type does not allow element "IMG" here"
if you place an image element behind the caption,
or if you have an empty figure without any image element.
If you omit the caption, the validating parser will
warn you about an "end tag for "FIGURE" which is not finished".

<sect>Miscancellous
<p>
There is no support for width, height, or scaling, which
are supposed to be formatting issues, depending on the
actual output format (e.g. paper size) and to be handled
by the backend. Customization is supposed to be done by
modifying the mapping tables.
<p>
There is no support for
rotation or mirroring of images. Basically, images are
not that much different from character entities; the
image element is just a placeholder for something the
backend will generate from a source (file). Note that
the filenames chosen do actually leak into the backend
(UNIX filenames in NT or DOS environments).
<p>
There is no alignment (right, left, center) with images.
This issue is not image specific, and applies to any
kind of inlines (e.g. plain text). The same is true for
more complicated arrangements or images; handling
tabular-like structures is not image specific as well.
