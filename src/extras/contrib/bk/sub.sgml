    This is sub.sgml, distributed with SGML-Tools.
    It is a SUBDOC to the subdoc.sgml example,
    but it can be verified separately.

<p>
Here you see that you could include an entire, DTD
compliant document as a SUBDOC of another, that could
as well be validated separately. You might as well
need a simple wrapper around providing the header and
trailer of a valid document. According to the
<q>Handbook</q>, each SUBDOC document could have a
different document type, specificed by the
respective <k>doctype</k> statement. With SGML-Tools,
this will still be limited to supported DTD's. It does
not work properly anyway.
