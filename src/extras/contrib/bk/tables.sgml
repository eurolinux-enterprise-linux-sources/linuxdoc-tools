    This is tables.sgml, distributed with SGML-Tools.
    It tests and describes the use of table and
    tabular element, to arrange data in rows and
    columns.

<title>TEST: Tables
<author>b. kreimeier
<date>May 1997

<abstract>
This document demonstrates the SGML Tools support for
table and tabular elements, essentially for means to
arrange data in columns and rows.
</abstract>


<sect>Simple Tables
<p>
Basically, tables are means to arrange data items 
in columns and rows. In SGML Tools, there is no
support for nested tables, or multicolumns, or
other sophisticated arrangements of data items.
<p>
Moreover, tables are handled as separate paragraphs,
comparable to figures. They float, that is will appear
at the position at which they are introduced, or below,
depending. Tables are placed centered, and have a
caption placed below. Unlike multiple image support
with figures, there is no support for multiple tables
within one - each table has its one caption. Subsequent
tables will be placed in a column.
<p>
Here is a minimal example:
<table>
<tabform>  <tdat><tdat>
<tabhead>    Left Heading     |  Right Heading
<tabular>   
						 Item 1/1 | Item 1/2 <tr>
             Item 2/1 | Item 2/2
</tabular>
<caption>
Minimal Table.
</caption>
</table>
You will notive that a table is always surrounded by
a border. The headling lines, which are highlighted,
could be omitted.
<table>
<tabform>  <tdat><tdat>
<tabular>   
						 Item 1/1 | Item 1/2 <tr>
             Item 2/1 | Item 2/2
</tabular>
<caption>
Table w/o Heading.
</caption>
</table>
<p>
Each table contains several elements: form, heading,
body, and caption.

<sect1>Table Form and Heading
<p>
Headings are treated differently even in the otherwise
sloppy HTML. This is relevant e.g. with respect to tools
like SGML-sensitive filters. We allow for multiple
heading lines. In LaTeX, this are distinctly rendered
by default, and separated from the table by double
rules.
<p>
The preceeding tabform element is a bit
awkward, as it is a good example of both descriptive markup
creeping into the SGML source, and ASP based backend
implementation shining through. It is needed
only because the current backend does not determine the
number of columns e.g. from the heading.
<p>
However, it might be useful for future extension, e.g.
for tables that contain a different class of information
in the leftmost column.


<sect1>Table Body and Caption
<p>
The Table Body is just a list of elements,
ie. data items, cell/column separators, and table row
separators.
<p>
Unfortunately, the validating parser does not check
the table for consistency. Thus, missing or
additional elements will proliferate into the backends,
and will only yield unpredictable results in HTML, but
errors in LaTeX. 
<p>
The caption is identical to the one used with figures.
It will be placed centered, below the actual table
itself.



<sect>Tables with Images 
<p>
Inlined elements like images could be placed in tables. Here
is a full sized example with all structure details.
<table>
<tabform>    <tdat><tdat><tdat><tdat><tdat>       
<tabhead>    Column A1  |    Column A2 |    Column B1 | Column B2   | Column B2a
<tabular>                  
 <img id="small_picture"> | 
                      Text     |  Text    |  Text    | Text  <tr>   
             Text   |          |          |  Text    | Text  <tr> 
             Text   | Text     |  Text    |  Text    | Text  <tr>
<img id="small_picture"> | 
                      Text     |  Text    |  Text    | Text  <tr>
             Text   | Text     |  Text    |
               <img id="small_picture"> | Text <tr> 
             Text   | Text     | 
    <img id="small_picture"> | Text     | Text <tr> 
                    | Text     |  Text    |  Text    | Text <tr>   
             Text   | Text     |  Text    |          | Text <tr>   
             Text   | Text     |          |  Text    |      <tr>   
                    | Text     |  Text    |          | Text
</tabular>
