*******************************************************************
SGML-Tools is going to chance, please read this document on every
version of SGML-Tools 1.0.x you install.
*******************************************************************


Check the website for details on the migration - the short version is
that we're going to drop the SGML-Tools DTD in favour of the more
widely established DocBook DTD. 

This will mean some work for authors, and in order to keep everybody
informed this file has been created for keeping you up-to-date.

Resume of migration path as it currently stands:

o At the moment, SGML-Tools 1.0.x is the productive version. People should
  upgrade from Linuxdoc-SGML and older SGML-Tools versions to this release
  in order to make sure that their documents are compatible
  with the current DTD;
o We're now starting SGML-Tools 1.1 development, which will be a hacker
  version. Later versions will likely be stable enough to give early
  adopters an early transition chance; 
o Hopefully 98Q3, SGML-Tools 2.0 will be released. This version will not
  support linuxdoc.dtd anymore, but will have an automated conversion
  tool from linuxdoc.dtd to DocBook. Authors should use 2.0 in order
  to migrate their documents;
o 6 months after SGML-Tools 2.0 release, support for SGML-Tools 1.0 
  will be dropped. LDP authors should have converted their documents
  by then; the SGML-Tools team will consider linuxdoc.dtd obsolete
  from then on.

Currently available tools for early adopters:

o SGML-Tools 1.1.0 is a collection of two alternative tools we can base
  on. On the one hand, there is Quilt with it's own (Perl-based) style
  sheets, on the other hand a collection of Cygnus-modified standard
  DSSSL stylesheets. If you really insist, I figure that you could
  actually use this.

o Paul Prescod (see SGML-Tools website for a reference) has a conversion
  DSSSL stylesheet that translates your LinuxDoc documents to DocBook. The
  output is ugly, though. This stylesheet will also be available in
  SGML-Tools 1.1.1, if  you're lazy.
