Encoding: 
- Bug (somebody reported it)
* Worked on (somebody took ownership)
! Testing (it's in the source tree, test it!)
+ Completed (testing went fine)
? Long-standing (is this still a bug ?)

============================================
? fix -man so it'll work for latin1, too 

- <tscreen><verb> doesn't keep indentation with sgml2txt (reported by
  Martin Michlmayr <tbm@cyrius.com> on 09-Feb-1997).

  (CdG - tscreen and verb are being replaced in sgmltool.dtd)

- (UW) sgml2txt produces a lot of
  "general entity .. not defined and no default entity"
  "warning: numeric expression expected (got `T')",
  "warning: `[' not defined", "escape character ignored before `T'",
  "warning: indent cannot be negative", "can't find special character `AN'",
  "normal or special character expected (got a space)",
  "warning: `..' not defined"
  Despite of that errors the exit code is 0 (zero).

  (ESR - I can't reproduce this with 0.99.19 on any of my four HOWTOs. 
  Perhaps it's gone away?)

- (UW) sgml2info produces several error messages:
	Making info file `manual.info' from `/tmp/sgmltmp.manual3318.4'.
	/tmp/sgmltmp.manual3318.4:11: Misplaced `{'.
  With the source line "Why Not Just Use {\LaTeX}?" I guess the braces are not
  handled properly.
