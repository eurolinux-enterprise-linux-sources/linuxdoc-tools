Encoding:
- Proposal (somebody mentioned it and it was considered a good idea)
* Worked on (somebody took ownership)
! Testing (it's in the source tree, test it!)
+ Completed (testing went fine)
? Long-standing (is this still a viable thing/not done already ?)

============================================  
? do we really need "expand $TABS"
? tables!
- Convert LyX stuff from sed and awk to Perl.
- support other character sets than latin1 (ISO 8859-1). Start out simple with
  the latin-n alternatives.
- --output-directory switch so the output files aren't automatically put
  in $(basename input-file).
