INTRODUCTION

    The ISO character entity sets are used in a wide variety of SGML
    document types.  This package installs these entity sets and a
    catalog to reference them.

SOURCE

    I know of no official online source of these entity sets.  I
    copied the files from the SGML Repository:

        <ftp://ftp.ifi.uio.no/pub/SGML/ENTITIES/>

    The ISO 8879:1986 character entity sets are static.  The ``point''
    release number of this package is the release of this packaging.
    This package is maintained at

        <ftp://ftp.uu.net/vendor/bitsko/iso-entities/>

INSTALLATION

    The entity sets need to be installed where your SGML processing
    system can find them.  Copy the `iso-entities.cat' catalog to the
    same directory.  Several packages will find the entity sets if you
    add the full path to `iso-entities.cat' to the environment
    variable `SGML_CATALOG_FILES', for example:

        SGML_CATALOG_FILES=/usr/lib/sgml/iso-entities-8879.1986/iso-entities.cat
        export SGML_CATALOG_FILES

    This package also comes with a `configure' script and `Makefile' that
    will install the entities following GNU install standards:

        zcat iso-entities-8879.1986.2.tar.gz | tar xvf -
        cd iso-entities-8879.1986
        ./configure
        make
        make install

    By default, the entities will be installed into
    `/usr/local/lib/sgml/iso-entities-8879.1986'.  The `--prefix'
    option to `configure' can be used to point to a different top
    level directory:

        ./configure --prefix=/usr
